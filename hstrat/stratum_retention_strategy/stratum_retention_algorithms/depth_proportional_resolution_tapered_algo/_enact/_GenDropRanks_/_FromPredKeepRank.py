        Every time a new stratum is deposited, this method is called on each
        stratum present in a HereditaryStratigraphicColumn to determine whether
        it should be retained. Strata that return False are immediately purged

        True result from this method each and every time a new stratum is
        deposited.

        Parameters
        ----------
        policy: Policy
            Policy this functor enacts.
        stratum_rank : int
            The number of strata that were deposited before the stratum under
            consideration for retention.
        num_stratum_depositions_completed : int
            The number of strata that have already been deposited, not
            including the latest stratum being deposited which prompted the
            current purge operation.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            True if the stratum should be retained, False otherwise.
