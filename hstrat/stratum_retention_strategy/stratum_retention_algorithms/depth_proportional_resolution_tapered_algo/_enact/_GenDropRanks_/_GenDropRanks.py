        Every time a new stratum is deposited, this method is called to
        determine which strata should be purged. All strata at ranks yielded
        from this functor are immediately purged from the column, meaning that
        for a stratum to persist it must not be yielded by this functor each
        and every time a new stratum is deposited.

        ----------
        policy: Policy
            Policy this functor enacts.
        num_stratum_depositions_completed : int
            The number of strata that have already been deposited, not
            including the latest stratum being deposited which prompted the
            current purge operation.
        retained_ranks : iterator over int
            An iterator over ranks of strata currently retained within the
            hereditary stratigraphic column. Not used in this functor.

        Returns
        -------
        iterator over int
                The ranks of strata that should be purged from the hereditary
            stratigraphic column at this deposition step.
