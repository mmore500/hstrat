    """Determine generations since divergence with particular confidence.

    How many depositions have elapsed along the focal column's line of
    descent since the first mismatching strata at the same rank between
    focal and other?

    Returns
    -------
    int, optional
        The number of depositions elapsed or None if no disparity (i.e.,
        both columns have same number of strata deposited and the most
        recent stratum is common between focal and other).

    Parameters
    ----------
    confidence_level : float, optional
        With what probability should the true number of ranks since the
        first disparity be less than or equal to the returned estimate?
        Default 0.95.

    Notes
    -----
    Returns -1 if focal and other share no mismatching strata at common
    ranks but other has more strata deposited than focal.

    The true number of ranks since the first disparity with other is
    guaranteed strictly less than or equal to the returned estimate when
    confidence_level < 0.5.
